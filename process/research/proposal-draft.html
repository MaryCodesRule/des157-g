<p>I have noticed that there is a lot of false information and consciousness about afro-textured hair and hair care. I feel like this lack of agency in mainstream media makes haircare for black people seem foreign not only from a outsiders perspective but from my own. Outside of my own personal life, for the most part, the media I consumed growing up to did portray anyone going through similar hair journey as me. While it is no secret that places like Hollywood lack diversity, accepting that as the law allows for creativity to die. I realized that as I was for searching games or any other interactive entertainment. This entertainment just did not exist such for either curly or afro-textured haired girls. I believe we deserve to see ourselves in media, more importantly, I believe it is a story worth sharing, spreading whether the story reflects your own or not. I think a choose your own adventure, choice based game following the hair journey of a African-American girl could be both timely and refreshing. I think this game will be fun and informative for all who consume. Hopefully breaking down some of the about black hair and hair care.
My target audience is adventurous and thoughtful. They will most likely skew female ages 13-30. Making less than $100,000 a year, though I do not really see salary as a factor. I image my audience will be from a more urban environment though that may change based on the popularity of the game.

  The goal of this project is to give more agency to an underrepresented class of hair. To allow those with this hair to have more confidence in what they know about there own haircare and if need be correct or educate on some other better practices to use if they see fit. To educate those who have no basis for this type of hair texture and to properly respect the person with texture as a human being not the main attraction of a petting zoo.
The project color palette will be that of pastels. Soft cotton candy-like feel. I want to go with something softer because I feel like black hair along with black people are often demonized/ Portrayed as something hard and distant and dangerous. I want to have this game be soft and smooth and easy to navigate to enhance the playing experience, but also the feeling you get when the game is over and you think about it and black hair itself. Iâ€™m thinking of using fonts like
<span style="color:lightblue;font-family:'Pacifico', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;"> Pacifico,</span> <span style="color:hotpink;font-family:'Merienda One', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;"> Merienda, </span><span style="color:orange;font-family:'Berkshire Swash', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px;">Berkshire Swash. </span> I feel these fonts used sparingly can add to the overall effect.
