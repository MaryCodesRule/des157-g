  <h2>1/22/2019</h2>
  <p>Looking at both projects it is easy to see the stark difference between the two, the only connecting factor is perhaps they are games aimed at females and star females.
    That is where the comparison ends. Hair Nah is an interactive rapid-fire gaming experience, while the Fly squad is more of a meditative experience.
    Hair Nah was created as both satire and enjoyable educational experience.
    Highlighting a topic that is not often spoken about, the treatment of black women and their hair by others.
    The game interface seems to be operating from a div in the body.
    The page is smooth, with complementary colors and a clear theme throughout.
    The game is well designed and engaging.
    For one there are several ways in which your avatar can look and several hairstyles to have during the play through.
    The game objective to make it to your chosen destination Santa Monica, Osaka or Havana while dodging offending white hands until you make it to your destination.
    There four levels, one at a restaurant, in a shared ride, at the airport security line and the hardest on the plane.
    The gameplay towards the end is difficult, but not impossible. It might take more than then a couple tries to reach the end.
    There you are greeted with a heartfelt note of the need for a certain amount of respect and dignity when dealing with black hair in public being one who doesn’t have it.
    It’s a call to action to respect boundaries and while done in a fun way touches a serious issue.<br>
    On the other hand fly Squad is a product of its climate.
    It’s a game obviously aimed at young girls, while Hair Nah is aimed at a much wider audience.
    The first is aimed to both educate and entertain, while the latter is for pure enjoyment.
    The objective of the game is to get one or many different looks on multiple models.
    While I do enjoy this kind of dress up game immensely, I feel like more can be done to educate young and old about hair specifically black hair.
    I think that Hair Nah is a perfect middle between education and gaming, besides a few small problems with the interface it is a gold standard.
    The one demerit I would give to is that you can not go into fullscreen so you constantly move the screen down to where the game is not making it a bit harder to play.</p>
