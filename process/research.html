 <h1>Why is Black Hair Mystfied?</h1>
</header>
<a>
  I think that Huffington post really hit the nail on the head. There truly is overlying miseducation and overall lack of education on black hair. Also called Natural hair, Afro-textured hair, Kinky hair, and black hair/African American hair(in the States).
  Whether your in the camp of person who believes that natural/ kinky hair is just like straight hair and therefore you know everything you need to or are foolish enough to think of it,
  not at all like human hair but some strange alien object that is there for your amusement.Black hair does not get its due. While studies have shown that all hair is made up of similar materials ie. sebum.
  Afro-textured hair is different on at the follicles then straight hair. A strand of Afro-textured hair is usually oval shaped as it is bent this way, but it also grows in curves instead of out of a person's hair.
  There is a lot of misunderstandings about Kinky hair, for instance, it does not need to be washed every day. While there a plenty of oils in natural hair,
  unlike with straight hair is is harder for the oils to distribute fully throughout the hair since it is not just traveling down.
  Because of this natural hair should not be washed every day, but every week at most to preserve healthy hair and stop breakage. <br>
  Or the falling out of hair. Black hair is often protected in protective styles, such as braids, cornrolls, buns, and wigs and weaves.
  Even still this these styles do have a dowsides. The danger of these styles are they can very much damnage natural hair. If braids
  are to tight, pull to much at the root or if the hair added to a weave or braids can cause the skin to breakout and dry up.
  Even still these protective styles are preferable because they protect the hair, they are low maintence once put in and are more
  acceptable to some while hair in its unaltered state and purely afro texture. Of course even the perhaps more safe Protective
  styles are met with ridculous contraversy. It seems like everyone and their mama has something to say about black hair.
  How it should look, where is its acceptable and if it should even be allowed in places like school and work, even the military.
  No other hair texture is every debated like this, only curly kinky hair is not 'acceptable'. Which is ridculous.
