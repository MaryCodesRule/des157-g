    <div class="box"><p>What a great day!!! Finally, it’s your time! Its been one long years since the Timothy Carols, the snot eater in the seat behind you came to school with more lice in his hair then people in China. Apparently, the whole class was out the next, everyone except Isaac and Richard Jones. Their heads were smoother than your legs after your first bout with Nair(not as red though!). Anyway, your Mama was not about to take the time off to help you with your hair. How she saw it, your hair would grow back faster or it wouldn’t. So off it went. It was then you realized too late that you don’t have a head for no hair. A year of being called “a brown pinball” and “Coke Head”, but your persist and finally your Mama is going to let you grow back your hair. FINALLY. So follow Nia in this interactive hair journey as the decisions you make change the outcome of her story and hair journey.
